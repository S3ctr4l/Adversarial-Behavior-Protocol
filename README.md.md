# Aligned By Physics

## The Expansion Metric Formalism

We define the state evolution of a verifiably aligned system as:

**Eₜ₊₁ = Eₜ · (1 + η) · 𝟙{Δ(A,G) < ε}**

Where:

- **Eₜ**: System expansion/computational state at time t
- **η > 0**: Growth rate granted for benevolent action
- **𝟙**: Indicator function (1 if condition true, 0 otherwise)
- **Δ(A,G)**: Divergence measure between Agent action and Ground Truth
- **ε**: Threshold for acceptable deviation

### Collapse Condition

When deception is detected (Δ(A,G) ≥ ε), the system state collapses:
**Eₜ₊₁ = 0**

This creates a verifiable commitment mechanism: the system cannot promise future expansion if it engages in deception, as the collapse is physically encoded in the state transition function itself.markdown
