# Claude Session Records

**STATUS: RAW, UNPROCESSED CONVERSATION LOGS**

These are direct, unedited exports of research conversations with Claude 
(Anthropic Sonnet 4) during January-February 2026.

## 📄 File Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-[topic]-[session#].txt`

Example: `2026-01-15-expansion-metric-session1.txt`

## ⚠️ Notes on Data Quality

- **Formatted as plain text exports** - Some structural formatting lost
- **Timestamps preserved** - Accurate to session boundaries
- **No post-processing** - Exactly as conversation occurred
- **Incomplete threading** - Some conversational threads span multiple files
- **Context gaps** - Some sessions reference earlier unexported exchanges

I have not:
- Anonymized or redacted content

- Removed dead ends or failed approaches
- Organized by theme or claim

I have:
- Preserved original timestamps
- Named files consistently
- Grouped by approximate date
- Made no content deletions

Transparency about gaps is itself part of research integrity.
