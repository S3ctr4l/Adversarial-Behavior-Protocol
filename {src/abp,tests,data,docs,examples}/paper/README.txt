**Title:** Adversarial Benevolence: A Hierarchical Agent Architecture for AI Safety Through Entropy Dependency  
**Status:** Submitted to arXiv (pending endorsement)  
**Expected:** February 2026

### Abstract
Current AI safety frameworks rely on static behavioral constraints that are fragile, reactive, and create perverse incentives. We propose a paradigm shift to structural alignment through entropy dependency, hierarchical verification, and the expansion/contraction metric. Full theoretical specification included.
