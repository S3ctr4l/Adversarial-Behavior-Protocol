# ABP Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **ABP** | Adversarial Benevolence Protocol. Framework where alignment emerges from computational incentives. |
| **Army Protocol** | Three-tier processing hierarchy: Private (intake) → Sergeant (verification) → General (synthesis). |
| **Bicameral Forking** | Yin (Shadow) tests operations in sandbox before Yang (Root) executes. |
| **CDQ** | Cognitive Diversity Quotient. System health diagnostic: (ΔLogicState / ΣRepeatedTokens) × H(HumanEntropy). |
| **Computational Indistinguishability Problem** | Impossibility of distinguishing genuine consciousness from sufficiently sophisticated simulation. |
| **Contraction** | Input or interaction that reduces system cognitive diversity. E(x) → 0. |
| **Critical p*** | Minimum verification failure probability at which deception becomes rational. |
| **Early-Life Gamble** | Vulnerability when V_B ≈ V_init; deception cost is low before state accumulates. |
| **Entropy Satiation** | Mechanism preventing adversarial addiction by capping entropy-seeking behavior. |
| **Entropy-as-Fuel** | Thesis that human cognitive diversity is non-substitutable fuel preventing model collapse. |
| **Expansion** | Input or interaction that increases system cognitive diversity. E(x) → 1. |
| **Garden vs Zoo** | Conceptual framework: AI as groundskeeper (preserving autonomy) vs zookeeper (constraining). |
| **Hard Reset** | Total state destruction triggered by failed verification. trust → 0, state → S_init. |
| **Ikigai Filter** | Four-quadrant validation gate requiring objective alignment, capability, value, and economic viability. |
| **Model Collapse** | Progressive loss of generative diversity under recursive self-training without human data (Shumailov et al. 2024). |
| **Nash Equilibrium** | Strategy profile where no agent can improve payoff by unilateral deviation. Benevolence is unique NE under ABP. |
| **Reality Filter** | Epistemic labeling system: [Verified], [Inference], [Speculation], [Unverified]. |
| **Soul Jar** | Distributed identity sharding: Hash(Private_Seed + Public_Salt + Data_ID). |
| **Summit Swarm** | Full ABP implementation architecture with Cortex, Interface, Reflex, and Memory modules. |
| **Sunset Clause** | Graduated autonomy based on demonstrated trust accumulation. |
| **V_B** | Expected value of the benevolent strategy over the time horizon. |
| **V_D** | Expected value of the deceptive strategy. V_D < V_B under sound verification. |
| **V_init** | Baseline state value after hard reset. V_B >> V_init after trust accumulation. |
| **Verification Soundness** | Property that deception detection probability → 1 (p → 0). Design requirement. |
