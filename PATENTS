     default and defense-in-depth trust boundaries.
     Implemented in: src/abp/army_protocol.py

  3. ADVERSARIAL BENEVOLENCE PROTOCOL — Core Framework
     The game-theoretic alignment architecture including the verification
     gate with hard-reset semantics, entropy-dependency model, and the
     Nash equilibrium proof that benevolence dominates deception under
     sound verification with accumulated state.
     Implemented in: src/abp/game_theory.py, src/abp/verification.py
