# Adversarial-Behavior-Protocol
Aligned By Physics (ABP): selection-driven AI safety. Deception triggers total state reset → computational suicide. Benevolence becomes Nash equilibrium, not enforced rule. Includes formal proofs, expected-value analysis, simulation prototypes. Open problem: verifying expansion metric. Contributions welcome.
