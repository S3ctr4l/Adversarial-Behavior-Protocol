# Commercial Licensing — Adversarial Benevolence Protocol

**Copyright (c) 2026 Joshua Roger Joseph Just. All rights reserved.**

## Overview

The Adversarial Benevolence Protocol (ABP) is available for non-commercial
use under CC BY-NC 4.0. All commercial use requires a separate written
agreement from the author.

## What Requires a Commercial License

You need a Commercial License if you or your organization:

- Integrate ABP methods into a commercial product or service
- Use ABP internally to support revenue-generating operations
- Deploy ABP within a proprietary AI system or platform
- Are a defense organization or government contractor using ABP
  in any funded program
- Offer consulting, training, or professional services using ABP
- Sublicense or distribute ABP as part of a paid offering

This applies regardless of whether you modify the code, regardless of
scale, and regardless of which version (v1.0 or v2.0) you obtained.

## What Does NOT Require a Commercial License

- Academic research at accredited institutions (with attribution)
- Personal, non-commercial experimentation
- Peer review and academic critique
- Teaching and coursework at educational institutions
- Non-profit AI safety research with publicly available outputs

## Patent Rights

v1.0 also did NOT grant patent rights.**
See the PATENTS file. A Commercial License covers both copyright and
patent rights.
