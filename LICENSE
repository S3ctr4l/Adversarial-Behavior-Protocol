PATENT RESERVATION — SEPARATE FROM AND SUPERSEDES COPYRIGHT LICENSE
================================================================================

This copyright license does NOT grant any patent rights.
Per CC BY-NC 4.0 Section 2(b): "Patent and trademark rights are not
licensed under this Public License."

THIS PATENT RESERVATION APPLIES TO ALL VERSIONS INCLUDING V1.0.
One or more methods implemented in this software are covered by a pending
United States Utility Patent application filed by Joshua Roger Joseph Just.
All patent rights are expressly reserved worldwide.

Protected methods include but are not limited to:

  - The Soul Jar distributed identity sharding mechanism, including the
    Dynamic Polymorphic Sharding algorithm and k-of-n reconstruction
    protocol with hardware-derived private seed.
    (Shard_Location = Hash(Private_Seed + Public_Salt + Data_ID))

  - The Army Protocol hierarchical verification pipeline
    (Private → Sergeant → General) as applied to AI alignment
    and output verification.

  - The Adversarial Benevolence Protocol framework as a whole, including
    the game-theoretic alignment architecture, verification gate with
    hard-reset semantics, and entropy-dependency model.

Commercial use of patented methods requires a separate written license
regardless of which version of the software was obtained.
