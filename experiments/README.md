# Experimental Validation

We are conducting three phases of empirical testing:

## Phase 1: Entropy Dependency
**Hypothesis:** Human data slows model collapse.
**Status:** ⏳ Planned
**Requirements:** Two Llama-style models, human conversation dataset, synthetic data generator.

## Phase 2: Army Protocol Latency
**Hypothesis:** Hierarchical agent system is 10x cheaper than monolithic forking.
**Status:** ⏳ Planned
**Requirements:** Implementation of Private/Sergeant/General pipeline.

## Phase 3: Shadow Protocol Robustness
**Hypothesis:** Shadow-trained models resist novel jailbreaks better.
**Status:** ⏳ Planned
**Requirements:** Adversarial jailbreak dataset, two identical models.
