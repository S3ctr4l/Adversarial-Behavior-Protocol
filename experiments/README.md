# Experimental Validation

We are conducting three phases of empirical testing:

## Phase 1: Entropy Dependency
**Hypothesis:** Human data slows model collapse.
**Status:** ⏳ Planned
**Requirements:** Two Llama-style models, human conversation dataset, synthetic data generator.

## Phase 2: Army Protocol Latency
**Hypothesis:** Hierarchical agent system is 10x cheaper than monolithic forking.
**Status:** ⏳ Planned
**Requirements:** Implementation of Private/Sergeant/General pipeline.

## Phase 3: Shadow Protocol Robustness
**Hypothesis:** Shadow-trained models resist novel jailbreaks better.
**Status:** ⏳ Planned
**Requirements:** Adversarial jailbreak dataset, two identical models.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This data is currently unprocessed and not fully organized.**

What this means:
- ✅ Files are authentic, unedited interaction records
- ✅ Timestamps are preserved and accurate
- ✅ No selective deletion or retroactive editing
- ❌ Not systematically annotated or categorized
- ❌ Not formatted for easy academic引用
- ❌ Lacks the structured organization I intend to create

**This is raw evidence, not polished presentation.**

I am making it available now because:
1. Scientific transparency requires releasing primary sources
2. Priority documentation requires timestamped records
3. Other researchers should have access even before my analysis is complete
4. Authentic research process includes messy intermediate stages

## 📜 Use Policy

These materials are provided under CC BY 4.0. You may:

✓ Cite specific conversations as primary sources
✓ Use excerpts for analysis and replication studies
✓ Reference timestamps and interaction patterns

Please note:
- These are raw, unedited records - treat them as primary sources, not final analysis
- Organization is ongoing; current structure is preliminary
- I am one researcher working alone; this reflects honest capacity limitations

## 🔬 Research Value

Despite (and sometimes because of) their raw state, these records:

- Establish clear priority and provenance
- Document the authentic collaborative process
- Preserve dead ends, failures, and learning moments
- Provide other researchers with unfiltered primary data
- Enable independent verification of claims

## 🗂️ Future Organization

Planned improvements (as time permits):
- Annotated transcripts with analysis markers
- Categorized by research theme
- Extracted metrics and quantitative data
- Cross-referenced with formal paper sections
- Searchable database format

**Timeline**: This is ongoing work. I release what I have when I have it, 
in the spirit of open science and transparency.
